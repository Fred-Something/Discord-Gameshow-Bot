Source code for a WIP Discord bot I use to help host gameshows.

The bot can read DMs with server members to collect responses using -w harvest. The most helpful feature is being able to read DMs it recieved while offline so I don't have to keep it running 24/7.
It also has support for 'technicals', which are restrictions for responses. This allows me to  itegrate twists easily.
Voting screens can also be generated for contestants to rank the responses, this allows the bot to do some basic verifications to make sure contestant votes are valid.

Planned features:
Slash commands
Better internal organisiation of data
Ability to record responses through ticket channels as well as DMs for better interaction with contestants
Internal results calculator (I currently use an external tool for this)
